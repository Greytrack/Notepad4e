### Contributing

Contributions are happily accepted through **pull requests** on GitHub. Feel free to fork the project and share your code!

You can also **star this repository** to support the open-source project!

### Setting your own working copy of the project

* Ensure you have a working version of the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (Java Development Kit).
* Download the [RCP and RAP Developers](https://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) version of Eclipse.
* Make a copy of the repository on your computer. You can also create your own fork by clicking on the *Fork* icon on the top right of this page.
* In Eclipse, go to *File* -> *Import...* -> *Existing Projects into Workspace*.
* In the *Select root directory* field, indicate the location where you downloaded the Notepad4e repository.
* Tick the project that appears in the *Projects* field and click *Finish*.
* You're ready to go! You can now either launch an instance of Eclipse running the plugin by right-clicking on the project and selecting *Run As* -> *Eclipse Application*, or you can export a plugin archive file by selecting *Export* -> *Deployable plug-ins and fragments*.
